👋 Hi! My name is Whitney. 

👀 I’m interested in learning about front end development tools and technologies, as well as software/websites to aid others in communication (I'm also a speech-language pathologist!).

🌱 I’m currently learning about JavaScript foundations, CSS, and HTML. 

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that focus on all of the foundational concepts as I am just now starting my front end development journey!
